# Notes and Impressions

* Shadowing variables in very nice, almost genious I would say. Essentially solves the hardest problem in programming â€” naming things.
* rustfmt and cargo - very common coming from Golang
* Ownership model is rather straightforward, essentially codified behaviour that you would already have. Remind me of Closure and functional languages somehow
