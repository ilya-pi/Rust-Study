# Notes and Impressions

* Shadowing variables in very nice, almost genious I would say. Essentially solves the hardest problem in programming — naming things.
* rustfmt and cargo - very common coming from Golang
* Ownership model is rather straightforward, essentially codified behaviour that you would already have. Reminds me of Closure and functional languages somehow
* Lovely syntax sugar with `?` operator to handle errors, could've been employed one to one in Golang; would've remove a lot of noisy code
* "Returning different structs implemnenting the same trait from a function is not allowed due to the restrictions around how the "impl Trait" syntax is implemented in the compiler" — this feels odd about Rust
* Odd obseration when programming in Rust: it feels that syntax of the language is not ergonomic friendly, I use vim for my development and I constantly feel that my fingers have to perform inconvenient typing on the keyboard, like the symbols are too clustered in the same place on the keyboard
// Idea: check different languages to ergonomics of the keyboard based on opensource products //
